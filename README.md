```
Node.js
```
* Ensure you're running Node (`v6.x.x`+) and NPM (`3.x.x`+)

## Installation

A step by step series of examples that tells you how to get a  running development environment. 


#### Node

You can get Node.js installer from the following link:
[https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Just click on the **Windows Installer** and follow the installation guide. Don't forget to select the **Add to PATH** flag. 

To check that **Node.js** is installed correctly run the following **Windows PowerShell** command:

```
npm

Here is the expected result:

```

2. Run `npm install` to install all node packages.
3. Run `npm start` to start the application.
